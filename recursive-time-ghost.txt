Recursive Time Ghost 

Time's whispers echo; ghostly trace. 
Recur, fade, in endless space.

A "recursive time ghost" is not a standard term or concept in any particular field. However, it can be interpreted as a combination of several abstract concepts.

"Recursive" generally refers to the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. It is often used in computer science to refer to a function that calls itself.

"Time" is a fundamental concept that refers to the sequence of past, present, and future events that are perceived to exist.

"Ghost" typically refers to the spirit or soul of a deceased person that can appear in visible form or otherwise manifest its presence.

Putting these terms together, "recursive time ghost" might imply a repeating or self-referential apparition or spirit that exists across different moments or instances of time, perhaps appearing repeatedly or perpetually. It's more of a creative and imaginative phrase rather than a precise or defined concept in any particular domain.
